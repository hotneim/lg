\title{Interpolate a univariate conditional density function}
\usage{
interpolate_conditional_density(lg_object, condition, nodes, extend = 0.3,
  gaussian_scale = lg_object$transform_to_marginal_normality)
}
\arguments{
\item{lg_object}{An object of type \code{lg}, as produced by the \code{lg}-function}

\item{condition}{A vector with conditions for the variables that we condition upon.
Must have exactly one more element than there are columns in the data}

\item{nodes}{Either the number of equidistant nodes to generate, or a vector of nodes
supplied by the user}

\item{extend}{How far to extend the grid beyond the extreme data points, in share of
the range}

\item{gaussian_scale}{Stay on the standard Gaussian scale, useful for the accept-reject
algorithm}
}
\description{
Estimates the conditional density function for one free variable on
a grid. Returns a function that interpolates between these grid points
so that it can be evaluated more quickly, without new optimizations.
