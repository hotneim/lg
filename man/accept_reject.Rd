\title{Generate sample from a conditional density estimate}
\usage{
accept_reject(lg_object, condition, n_new, nodes, M = NULL, M_sim = 1500,
  M_corr = 1.5, n_corr = 1.2, return_just_M = FALSE, extend = 0.3)
}
\arguments{
\item{lg_object}{An object of type \code{lg}, as produced by the \code{lg}-function}

\item{n_new}{The number of observations to generate}

\item{nodes}{Either the number of equidistant nodes to generate, or a vector of nodes
supplied by the user}

\item{M}{The value for M in the accept-reject algorithm if already known}

\item{M_sim}{The number of replicates to simulate in order to find a value for M}

\item{M_corr}{Correction factor for M, to be on the safe side}

\item{n_corr}{Correction factor for n_new, so that we mostly will generate enough
observations in the first go}

\item{return_just_M}{\code{TRUE} if we just want to find M, without actually generating
any replications.}

\item{extend}{How far to extend the grid beyond the extreme data points when interpolating,
in share of the range}
}
\description{
Generate a sample from a locally Gaussian conditional density estimate using
the accept-reject algorithm.
