\title{Plugin bandwidth selection for multivariate data}
\usage{
bw_select_plugin_multivariate(x = NULL, n = nrow(x), c = 1.75, a = -1/6)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{The data matrix.}

\item{n}{The number of data points. Can provide only this if we do not want
to supply the entire data vector.}

\item{c}{A constant, se details.}

\item{a}{A constant, se details.}
}
\value{
A number, the selected bandwidth.
}
\description{
Returns a plugin bandwidth for multivariate data matrices for the estimation
of local Gaussian correlations
}
\details{
This function takes in a data matrix with \code{n} rows, and returns a the
real number \code{c*n^a}, which is a quick and dirty way of selecting a
bandwidth for locally Gaussian density estimation. The number  \code{c} is by
default set to \code{1.75}, and \code{c = -1/5} is the usual exponent, that
stems from the asymptotic convergence rate of the density estimate. This
function is usually called from the \code{lg} wrapper function.

\examples{
  x <- cbind(rnorm(100), rnorm(100))
  bw <- bw_select_plugin_multivariate(x = x)
  bw <- bw_select_plugin_multivariate(n = 100)
