\title{The locally Gaussian density estimator (LGDE)}
\usage{
dlg(lg_object, grid = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{lg_object}{An object of type \code{lg}, as produced by the
\code{lg}-function}

\item{grid}{A matrix of grid points, where we want to evaluate the density
estimate}
}
\value{
A list containing the density estimate as well as all the running
  parameters that has been used. The elements are:

  \itemize{
    \item \code{f_est}: The estimated multivariate density.
    \item \code{loc_mean}: The estimated local means if \code{est_method}
          is "5par" or "5par_marginals_fixed", a matrix of zeros if
          \code{est_method} is "1par".
    \item \code{loc_sd}: The estimated local st. deviations if
          \code{est_method} is "5par" or "5par_marginals_fixed", a matrix
           of ones if \code{est_method} is "1par".
    \item \code{loc_cor}: Matrix of estimated local correlations, one column
          for each pair of variables, in the same order as specified in the
          bandwidth object.
    \item \code{x}: The data set.
    \item \code{bw}: The bandwidth object.
    \item \code{transformed_data}: The data transformed to approximate
          marginal standard normality.
    \item \code{normalizing_constants}: The normalizing constants used to
          transform data and grid back and forth to the marginal standard
          normality scale, as seen in eq. (8) of Otneim & Tjøstheim (2017).
    \item \code{grid}: The grid where the estimation was performed, on the
          original scale.
    \item \code{transformed_grid}: The grid where the estimation was
          performed, on the marginal standard normal scale.

\description{
Estimate a mulivariate density function using locally Gaussian approximations
}
\details{
This function does multivariate density estimation using the locally Gaussian
density estimator (LGDE), that was introduced by Otneim & Tjøstheim (2017).
The function takes as arguments an \code{lg}-object as produced by the main
\code{lg}-function (where all the running parameters are sepcified), and a
grid of points where the density estimate should be estimated.
}
\examples{
   x <- cbind(rnorm(100), rnorm(100), rnorm(100))
   lg_object <- lg(x)  # Put all the running parameters in here.
   density_estimate <- dlg(lg_object)
