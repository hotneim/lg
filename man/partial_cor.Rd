\title{Calculate the local Gaussian partial correlation}
\usage{
partial_cor(lg_object, grid = NULL, condition = NULL, level = 0.95)
}
\arguments{
\item{lg_object}{An object of type \code{lg}, as produced by the
\code{lg_main}-function.}

\item{grid}{A matrix of grid points, where we want to evaluate the density
estimate. Number of columns *must* be equal to 2.}

\item{condition}{A vector with conditions for the variables that we condition
upon. Length of this vector *must* be the same as the number of variables in
X3. The function will throw an error of there is any discrepancy in the
dimensions of the \code{grid}, \code{condition} and data set.}

\item{level}{Specify a level if asymptotic standard deviations and confidence
intervals should be returned. If not, set to \code{NULL}.}
}
\value{
A list conaining the local partial Gaussian correlations as well as all the
  running parameters that has been used. The elements are:

  \itemize{
    \item \code{grid} The grid where the estimation was performed, on the
          original scale.
    \item \code{partial_correlations} The estimated local partial Gaussian
          correlations.
    \item \code{cond_density} The estimated conditional density of X1 and X2 given
          X3, as described by Otneim & Tjøstheim (2018).
    \item \code{transformed_grid}: The grid where the estimation was
          performed, on the marginal standard normal scale.
    \item \code{bw}: The bandwidth object.
    \item \code{partial_correlations_sd} Estimated standard deviations of the local
          partial Gaussian correlations, as described in a forthcoming paper.
    \item \code{partial_correlations_lower} Lower confidence limit based on the
          asymptotic standard deviation.
    \item \code{partial_correlations_upper} Upper confidence limit based on the
          asymptotic standard deviation.

\description{
A function that calculates the local Gaussian partial correlation for a pair
of variables, given the values of some conditionaing variables.
}
\details{
This function is a wrapper for the \code{clg}-function (for conditional
density estimation) that returns the local conditional, or partial,
correlations described by Otneim & Tjøstheim (2018). The function takes as
arguments an \code{lg}-object as produced by the main \code{lg_main}-
function, a grid of points where the density estimate should be estimated, and
a set of conditions.

The variables must be sorted before they are supplied to this function. It
will always assume that the free variables come before the conditioning
variables, see \code{?clg} for details.

Assume that X is a stochastic vector with scalar components X1 and X2, and a
possibly d-dimensional component X3. This function will thus compute the local
*partial* correlation between X1 and X2 given X3 = x3.

  # A 3 variate example
  x <- cbind(rnorm(100), rnorm(100), rnorm(100))

  # Generate the lg-object with default settings
  lg_object <- lg_main(x)

  # Estimate the local partial Gaussian correlation between X1 and X2 given X3 = 1 on
  # a small grid
  partial_correlations <- partial_cor(lg_object,
                                     grid = cbind(-4:4, -4:4),
                                     condition = 1)
