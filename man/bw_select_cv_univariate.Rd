\title{Cross-validation for univariate distributions}
\usage{
bw_select_cv_univariate(x, tol = 10^(-3))
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{The vector of data points.}

\item{tol}{The absolute tolerance in the optimization, passed to the
\code{optim}-function using the BFGS-method.}
}
\value{
The function returns a list with two elements: \code{bw} is the
  selected bandwidth, and \code{convergence} is the convergence flag returned
  by the \code{optim}-function.
}
\description{
Uses cross-valdiation to find the optimal bandwidth for a univariate locally
Gaussian fit
}
\details{
This function provides the univariate version of the Cross Validation
algorithm for bandwidth selection described in Otneim & Tjøstheim (2017),
Section 4. Let \eqn{\hat{f}_h(x)} be the univariate locally Gaussian density
estimate obtained using the bandwidth \eqn{h}, then this function returns the
bandwidth that maximizes \deqn{CV(h) = n^{-1} \sum_{i=1}^n \log
\hat{f}_h^{(-i)}(x_i),} where \eqn{\hat{f}_h^{(-i)}} is the density estimate
calculated without observation \eqn{x_i}.
}
\examples{
  x <- rnorm(100)
  bw <- bw_select_cv_univariate(x)
