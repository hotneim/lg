\usage{
dlg_bivariate(x, eval_points = NA, grid_size = 15, bw = c(1, 1),
  est_method = "1par", tol = .Machine$double.eps^0.25/10^4,
  run_checks = TRUE, marginal_estimates = NA, bw_marginal = NA)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{The data matrix (or data frame). Must have exactly 2 columns}

\item{eval_points}{The grid where the density should be estimated. Must have
exactly 2 columns}

\item{grid_size}{If \code{eval_points} is not supplied, then the function
will create a suitable grid diagonally through the data, with this many
grid points}

\item{bw}{The two bandwidths, a numeric vector of length 2}

\item{est_method}{The estimation method, must either be "1par" for estimation
with just the local correlation, or "5par"  for a full locally Gaussian fit
with all 5 parameters}

\item{tol}{The numerical tolerance to be used in the optimization. Opnly
applicable in the 1-parameter optimization}

\item{run_checks}{Logical. Should sanity checks be run on the arguments?
Useful to disable this when doing cross-validation for example.}

\item{marginal_estimates}{Provide the marginal estimates here if estimation
method is "\code{5par_marginals_fixed}", and the marginal estimates have
already been found. Useful for cross-valdiation. List with two elements as
returned by \code{dlg_marginal_wrapper}}

\item{bw_marginal}{Vector of bandwidths used to estimate the marginal
distributions}
}
\value{
A list including the data set \code{$x}, the grid
  \code{$eval_points}, the bandwidths \code{$bw}, as well as a matrix of the
  estimated parameter estimates \code{$par_est} and the estimated bivariate
  density \code{$f_est}.
}
\description{
\code{dlg_bivariate} returns the locally Gaussian density estimate of a
bivariate distribution on a given grid.
}
\details{
This function serves as the backbone in the body of methods concerning local
Gaussian correlation. It takes a bivariate data set, \code{x}, and a
bivariate set of grid points \code{eval_points}, and returns the bivariate,
locally Gaussian density estimate in these points. We also need a vector of
bandwidths, \code{bw}, with two elements, and an estimation method
\code{est_method}
}
\examples{
  x <- cbind(rnorm(100), rnorm(100))
  bw <- c(1, 1)
  eval_points <- cbind(seq(-4, 4, 1), seq(-4, 4, 1))

  estimate <- dlg_bivariate(x, eval_points = eval_points, bw = bw)
