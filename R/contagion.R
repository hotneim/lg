#' Test for financial contagion
#'
#' Test for financial contagion by means of the local Gaussian correlation.
#'
#' This function is an implementation of the test for financial contagion
#' developed by Støve, Tjøstheim and Hufthammer (2013). They test whether the
#' local correlations between two financial time series are different before and
#' during crisis times. The distinction between crisis and non-crisis times must
#' be made by the user.
#'
#' @param lg_object_nc An object of type \code{lg}, as produced by the
#'   \code{lg_main}-function for the observations covering the non-crisis
#'   period. The data must be two dimensional.
#' @param lg_object_c An object of type \code{lg}, as produced by the
#'   \code{lg_main}-function for the observations covering the crisis period.
#'   The data must be two dimensional.
#' @param grid_range This test measures the local correlations a long the
#'   diagonal specified by this vector of length two.
#' @param grid_length The number of grid points.
#' @param n_rep The number of bootstrap replicates.
#' @param weight Weight function
#'
#' @return A list containing the test result as well as various parameters. The
#'   elements are:
#'
#'   \itemize{
#'     \item \code{observed} The observed value of the test statistic.
#'     \item \code{replicated} The replicated values of the test statistic.
#'     \item \code{p_value} The p-value of the test.
#'     \item \code{local_correlations} The local correlations measured along the
#'      diagonal, for the non-crisis and crisis periods respectively.
