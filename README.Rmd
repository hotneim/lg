# The lg package for calculating local Gaussian correlations in multivariate applications

Otneim and Tjøstheim (2017a) describes a new method for estimating multivariate density functions using the concept of local Gaussian correlations. Otneim and Tjøstheim (2017b) expands the idea to the estimation of *conditional* density functions. This package, written for the R programming language, provides a simple interface for implementing these methods in practical problems.
