Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors@R: person("HÃ¥kon", "Otneim", email = "hakon.otneim@nhh.no", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: An implementation of locally Gaussian distributions in R. It provides methods for
    implementing the locally Gaussian density estimator (LGDE), as well as the corresponding
    estimator for conditional density functions. Further, functions for conditional independence
    tests and classification using local Gaussian correlations are included.
