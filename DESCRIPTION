Authors@R: person("HÃ¥kon", "Otneim", email = "hakon.otneim@nhh.no", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: An implementation of locally Gaussian distributions. It provides methods for
    implementing locally Gaussian multivariate density estimation, conditional density 
    estimation, various independence tests for iid and time series data, a test for conditional 
    independence and a test for financial contagion.
